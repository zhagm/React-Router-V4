# OfficePlace ðŸ–¥

OfficePlace is a virtual office space for your team, closing the distance between remote coworkers so that even when youâ€™re working on your own, youâ€™re working together.

### Core Functionality

OfficePlace allows users to create a virtual environment where users can go for accountability and communication. In times like these when working in a physical office is not an option, it's helpful to have a virtual space that emulates an open office space where you can see when your coworkers/peers are present at their desks. The purpose of the app is to close the distance between remote coworkers, so even when youâ€™re working on your own, youâ€™re working together.

### Features
