# OfficePlace ðŸ–¥

OfficePlace is a virtual office space for your team, closing the distance between remote coworkers so that even when youâ€™re working on your own, youâ€™re working together.

### Core Functionality

OfficePlace allows users to create a virtual environment where users can go for accountability and communication. In times like these when working in a physical office is not an option, it's helpful to have a virtual space that emulates an open office space where you can see when your coworkers/peers are present at their desks. The purpose of the app is to close the distance between remote coworkers, so even when youâ€™re working on your own, youâ€™re working together.

### Features

- Virtual accountability - a space where you can see your coworkers and who's active
- User registration and login
- Just one room
- Grid of desks - basic css grid
- Desk indicates if user is in office or not (logged in), and at the desk or not (active) through simple status

### Stack

- React frontend
- Node backend with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhagm/officeplace.git
```

Move into project directory and install all dependencies.

```bash
cd officeplace
```

```bash
npm run install-all
```

The project requires a couple environment variables. You can find a in the root directory named .sample-env
You can update the keys but I put some test keys so that your app still functions as it should.
.sample-env is just a placeholder, we'll want to rename it to .env to work with the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) library.

```bash
mv .sample-env .env
```

And voila, you should be ready to run!

## Usage

This project is structured into a separate frontend and backend. To run both concurrently you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
